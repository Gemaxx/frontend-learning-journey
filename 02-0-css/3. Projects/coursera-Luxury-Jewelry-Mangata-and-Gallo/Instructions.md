# Project: Home Page for a Fictional Client

## Overview

By working through the lessons in this course you must build a semantic home page for a fictional client. Create an HTML file (`index.html`) and a CSS file (`style.css`) and use either CSS Grid or Flexbox for layout. The page should include a header, main content, and footer.

## Requirements

- Header
  - Client logo at the top
  - Horizontal navigation menu with four links (one link must point to the home page)
- Main content
  - Large promotional banner at the top
  - Three columns below the banner, each containing an image and text
  - Use appropriate semantic elements (e.g., `main`, `section`, `article`)
- Footer
  - Two columns:
    - Left column: small version of the logo
    - Right column: copyright/other copywriting information

## Styling and Interactivity

- Use CSS (Grid or Flexbox) for layout
- Apply selectors, pseudo-classes, transitions/animations as appropriate
- Ensure effects improve UX and are not distracting
- Keep selectors minimal and avoid over-specificity

## Visual Layout Checklist (for reviewers)

- Is it clear which fictional client the page represents?
- Is the correct logo displayed at the top?
- Is there a horizontal navigation under the logo with four links?
- Does one nav link reference the home page?
- Is there a large banner and three image/text columns in the main area?
- Is there a footer split into two columns with logo (left) and copyright (right)?

## Semantic Structure Checklist (for reviewers)

- Is there a `header` element for the logo?
- Is there a `nav` element for navigation?
- Is there a `main` element for content?
- Is there a `footer` element for the footer?
- Are other semantic tags (e.g., `article`, `section`) used appropriately?

## CSS Review Points

- Is the layout implemented with Grid or Flexbox?
- Are selectors appropriate and not over-specific?
- Are pseudo-classes used for interactivity?
- Are animations/transitions used and do they enhance the experience?

## Submission Instructions

- Develop the pages locally (VS Code) or in the provided UGL Project sandbox.
- Download your files before ending a sandbox session (sandbox sessions are temporary).
- Submit a zipped project folder containing `index.html` and `style.css`.
- For help zipping/unzipping, consult the Mac or Windows support pages.

## Peer Review Process

- After submission you must review two peer projects.
- Download their zipped folders, unzip, and view the HTML in a browser.
- Inspect their HTML and CSS (VS Code or any text editor).
- Focus feedback on semantics, layout, and CSS styling/effects.

## Strong Home Page Characteristics

- Correctly formatted and valid HTML/CSS
- Required layout accomplished and visually pleasing
- Proper semantic HTML tags used
- `head` contains appropriate meta tags
- CSS selectors concise and minimal
- Coherent styling and intentional engagement
- Effects/animations complement design and do not distract

## Weak Home Page Indicators

- Required layout not executed
- Poorly formatted or erroneous HTML/CSS
- Missing meta tags in `head`
- Lack of semantic HTML tags
- Overly specific CSS selectors
- Unpleasant styling or distracting animations
- Limited or incorrect use of CSS for visual effect

Develop your home page to meet the criteria above and be prepared to give constructive feedback to two peers based on these points.
