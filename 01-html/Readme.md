### Input forms
- The input list attribute refers to a <datalist> element that contains pre-defined options for an <input> element. I would use it for (create / select entities instances)
for each input element, specify suitable attr that enhance both user experince and data handling at ui level: 
    know & search for the attrs of each element that would help, example:
        - validation attrs
        - placeholder
        - disable btn on submiting

- Note: Input restrictions are not foolproof, and JavaScript provides many ways to add illegal input. To safely restrict input, it must also be checked by the receiver (the server)!

- tip: Always specify both the height and width attributes for images.
