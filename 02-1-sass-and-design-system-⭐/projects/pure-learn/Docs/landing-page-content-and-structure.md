# The Problem
Self-learners are drowning in fragmented tools:
- Notes in one app, tasks in another, timers somewhere else.  
- No clear roadmap, no way to measure growth.  
- Constantly starting, rarely finishing.

> “The pressure to stay ahead is real, but I can’t waste time hunting for learning systems anymore.”  
— Daniel, Senior Software Engineer
